# TexasDoDSolarPower

For Intro to Programming with Python

Using geoprossesing scripts with arcpy. 

Python 2 for ArcGIS

The objective of the work described is to determine what DoD installations in
Texas meet land requirements for solar panels. This model will take already existing
shapefile data of DoD sites, and combine it with remotely sensed images of the area, to
determine suitable locations for these solar panels, if any. Then the model will create shapefiles of locations
> 75 acres. The model will then return how many solar powers can fit in the created shapefiles.
